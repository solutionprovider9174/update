Here you will find a crime dataset from Boston, MA. We would like you to create a prototype application to enable an analyst to view summary details on the Boston crime dataset. Specifically, we would like you to create a service that receives from date and to date inputs and returns the 7-day moving average (daily, taking average of 7 previous days) of number of crimes committed during that period across the entire city. 

Additional details:
- Implement a lightweight SQL based implementation to interrogate the dataset.
- Implement a REST API to implement the 7-day moving average service described above.
- Provide a brief description of the approach you took, noting any decisions you made as part of the process.
- We will be reviewing your implementation for code quality and technical design decisions.
- Do Mysql or postgresql local database with node.js 14
- Note: please focus on code quality as this test is simple one, the client wants to look for your skillset.

Bonus: Enhance the service to also receive an input district, and return the 7-day moving average (daily, taking average of 7 previous days) of number of crimes committed during that period for the specified district.
